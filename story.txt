Vic and his friends are going hiking. That was a beautiful day. While Vic and his friends are enjoying their time on the mountain, suddenly snow comes. 
"What a pity!" complained Vic. 
"Should we go back?" ask one of his friends. 

"No!" answered Mat resolutely. "We must press on! We are almost half way there!"
But, as the group started back along the trail, they were struck by a mighty, 
howling wind. They had not walked 10 more feet when the wind throw down an old 
oak tree in their path.

Vic and his friends climbed over the fallen oak tree, recognizing the luck that
they had that it hadn't fallen on top of any of them. Continuing onwards, they
happened upon high, icey wall in front of them, containing what looked to be a
hollow, carved into the ice. Wanting to get out of the storm, the group headed
inside.
